k7j âœ… file_replace_text /Users/stuart/repos/slupe-ascii-demo/src/artist.py
=== END ===
Ah, the first replacement actually worked! The robot now has color in the `draw_robot()` function. But there's still an issue - in `main()`, we're printing with `Fore.WHITE` which is overriding the colors. Let me fix that:

```sh nesl
#!nesl [@three-char-SHA-256: k7j]
action = "file_replace_text"
path = "/Users/stuart/repos/slupe-ascii-demo/src/artist.py"
old_text = <<'EOT_k7j'
    print(Fore.WHITE + draw_robot())
EOT_k7j
new_text = <<'EOT_k7j'
    print(draw_robot())
EOT_k7j
#!end_k7j
```
