I see the issue. The test is showing that `files_read` is returning success (✅) even when some files fail, but the listener component isn't aware of the partial failure status. We need to look at how the listener formats the results.

Let me first check what the actual response from `files_read` looks like:

```sh nesl
#!nesl [@three-char-SHA-256: rd1]
action = "file_read"
path = "/Users/stuart/repos/slupe/proj/comp/listener/src/index.ts"
#!end_rd1
```
