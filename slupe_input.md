I'll add a test case for `files_read` with partial failures to the listener workflow integration tests. This will ensure the output formatting works correctly when some files are missing.

```sh nesl
#!nesl [@three-char-SHA-256: ft1]
action = "file_replace_text"
path = "/Users/stuart/repos/slupe/proj/comp/listener/test-data/integration/listener-workflow-v2.cases.md"
old_text = <<'EOT_ft1'

This test case demonstrates:

1. **Summary Line**: Shows `⚠️` (warning) instead of ✅ or ❌, with a clear summary: "Read 2 of 5 files (3 failed)"

2. **Detailed Output**: 
   - Clear summary at the top showing success/failure counts
   - Separate sections for successful and failed files
   - Full error messages for each failed file
   - Complete content for successfully read files

3. **User-Friendly Format**:
   - Uses visual indicators (✅/❌) for clarity
   - Groups successes and failures separately
   - Shows the actual file content only for files that were successfully read

The warning symbol (⚠️) indicates partial success, which is more accurate than showing complete success (✅) or complete failure (❌) for this scenario.
