I'll make the robot dance with some animated movements! Let me create an enhanced version with multiple dance poses and smooth animation.

The robot now:
- Has 8 different dance poses with arm movements, expressions, and leg positions
- Cycles through rainbow colors while dancing
- Moves horizontally back and forth as it dances
- Shows musical notes at the bottom
- Has a friendly goodbye message when you stop it

Run it and watch your robot bust some moves! Press Ctrl+C when you want to stop the dance party.
