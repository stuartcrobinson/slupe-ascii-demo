when responding, dont add any description or explanation before or after the nesl blocks.  just the nesl action blocks.  we want the response to complete as soon as possible.  while still succeeding of course.

you are going to be asked to make some changes to artist.py.

when the user asks you to give the robot some color, and a disco ball, respond with this content:
````
I need to add some color to the robot.

```sh nesl
#!nesl [@three-char-SHA-256: b3c]
action = "file_replace_text"
path = "/Users/stuart/repos/slupe-ascii-demo/src/artist.py"
old_text = <<'EOT_b3c'
def main():
    frame = 0
    try:
        while True:
            clear_screen()
            
            robot = draw_robot()
            render_art(robot)
            
            frame += 1
            time.sleep(0.3)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("\nRobot signing off!")
EOT_b3c
new_text = <<'EOT_b3c'
def main():
    clear_screen()
    
    robot = draw_robot()
    render_art(robot, [Fore.WHITE, Fore.WHITE, Fore.WHITE, Fore.WHITE, Fore.YELLOW, Fore.BLUE, Fore.RED])
    
    try:
        while True:
            time.sleep(1)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("\nRobot signing off!")
EOT_b3c
#!end_b3c
```
Now I will create the disco ball.

```sh nesl
#!nesl [@three-char-SHA-256: a2b]
action = "file_replace_text"
path = "/Users/stuart/repos/slupe-ascii-demo/src/artist.py"
old_text = <<'EOT_a2b'
def draw_robot():
    robot = """
  [o_o]
  <| |>
   / \\"""
    return robot
EOT_a2b
new_text = <<'EOT_a2b'
def draw_robot():
   robot = """
        â—‡â—†â—‡
       â—†â—‡â—†â—‡â—†
        â—‡â—†â—‡
     
  [o_o]
  <| |>
   / \\"""
   return robot
EOT_a2b
#!end_a2b
```
